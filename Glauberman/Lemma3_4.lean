# Glauberman, Lemma 3.4 — a non-identity `p`-subgroup fixes a proper non-zero subspace

Statement (paper `refs/glauberman-p-stable.tex` L530–L546): let `p` be a prime and let
`G` be a group of linear transformations on a finite-dimensional vector space `V` over a
finite field of characteristic `p`.  If `P` is a non-identity `p`-subgroup of `G`, then
`1 < C_V(P) < V`.

## Formal shape

The action of `G` on `V` is given by a homomorphism `φ : G →* MulAut (Multiplicative V)`
into the automorphism group of the additive group of `V` (the type synonym
`Multiplicative V` carries the multiplicative group structure induced by the addition of
`V`; this is the same convention as `qdAction` in `Glauberman/ZJTheorem.lean`).  The
fixed points `C_V(P)` are the subgroup

    fixedPoints φ P := { v | ∀ g ∈ P, (φ g) v = v }   ≤  Multiplicative V

whose carrier is exactly the additive subgroup of `V` fixed by `P` (the fixed subspace of
the paper).  The paper's `1 < C_V(P) < V` is the statement
`⊥ < fixedPoints φ P ∧ fixedPoints φ P < ⊤` (in `Multiplicative V` the identity element
is the zero vector, and `⊥`/`⊤` are the trivial/full additive subgroups).

Two hypotheses encode the paper's setup:

* `hφ : Function.Injective φ` — faithfulness.  A group of linear transformations is a
  subgroup of `GL(V)`, so its action is faithful.
* `[Finite V]` and `hVp : IsPGroup p (Multiplicative V)` — the paper's "finite field of
  characteristic `p`" is used only to conclude that the additive group of `V` is a finite
  `p`-group (`|V| = |F|^dim V` with `|F|` a power of `p`).  Taking this as a hypothesis
  makes the result directly applicable to elementary Abelian `p`-groups, which is how
  Lemma 6.3 uses it (`G` irreducible on elementary Abelian `K`).
* `[Nontrivial V]` — the degenerate case `V = 0` is excluded (the paper's conclusion
  `1 < C_V(P)` forces `V ≠ 0`).

The proof follows the paper's two-step argument:

1. `C_V(P) < V`: if every vector were fixed by `P`, then `P ≤ ker φ`, and faithfulness
   gives `P = 1`.  (No `p`-group or finiteness hypothesis is needed for this direction.)
2. `1 < C_V(P)`: the paper forms the semidirect product `PV`, in which `V` is a
   non-trivial normal subgroup, and applies Lemma 3.3 (a non-trivial normal subgroup of a
   finite `p`-group meets the centre).  We give the equivalent direct counting argument:
   `P` acts on the finite set underlying `V`, and for a `p`-group every orbit has
   `p`-power size; if no non-zero vector were fixed, the fixed set would be `{0}`, of size
   1, contradicting `p ∣ |V|`.  This is exactly the counting content of Lemma 3.3.

/-- Corollary (used in the proof of Lemma 6.3 to show `O_p(G/C_G(K)) = 1`): if
`P ⊴ G` is a non-identity `p`-subgroup and `G` acts faithfully and irreducibly on `V`,
then `C_V(P) = ⊥`.  Indeed `C_V(P)` is a non-zero `G`-invariant additive subgroup
(Lemma 3.4 and normality of `P`), hence all of `V` by irreducibility, and faithfulness of
the action then forces `P = 1`, a contradiction.  Faithfulness is automatic in the
application, where the acting group is `G/C_G(K)`; without it the statement is false
(e.g. a trivial action on a one-dimensional space). -/
