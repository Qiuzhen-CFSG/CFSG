# Glauberman, Lemma 5.3 ([6], §5; `refs/glauberman-p-stable.tex` L1460–L1475)

Let `P` be a normal subgroup of a finite `p`-group `S`, and let `A` be the automorphism
group of `S`.  Then `C_A(P) ∩ C_A(S/P)` — the automorphisms of `S` that fix `P` pointwise
and induce the identity on the quotient `S ⧸ P` — is a `p`-group.

## Proof (paper L1462–L1472)

Let `a` lie in the intersection and put `n = |P|`.  For `g ∈ S` write `g^a = g·h(g)` with
`h(g) ∈ P` (this is where the identity-on-`S/P` condition is used: `a` maps every coset to
itself).  Since `a` fixes `P` pointwise, `h(g)^a = h(g)`, so by induction on `k`
`g^(aᵏ) = g·h(g)ᵏ`; in particular `g^(aⁿ) = g·h(g)ⁿ = g` because `h(g) ∈ P` and the order
of `h(g)` divides `n = |P|`.  Hence `aⁿ = 1`.  Since `P` is a subgroup of the finite
`p`-group `S`, `n = |P|` divides `|S| = pᵐ`, so `n` is a power of `p`; therefore every
element of the intersection has `p`-power order, i.e. the intersection is a `p`-group.

The paper uses this lemma in the proof of Lemma 6.3 for the group
`C_N(K)/(C_N(K) ∩ D)`; the statement is kept general here (any finite `p`-group `S`).

Note on the shape of condition (ii): instead of building the induced automorphism
homomorphism `C_A(P) →* MulAut (S ⧸ P)` and taking its kernel, the identity-on-`S/P`
condition is expressed directly on representatives: `a` maps every coset to itself
(`QuotientGroup.mk' P (a x) = QuotientGroup.mk' P x`), which is exactly what the proof
needs (`h(g) ∈ P` in the paper's notation) and keeps the definition usable.

(the coset condition), induction on `k` gives `g^(aᵏ) = g·h(g)ᵏ` (using that `a`, hence
every power of `a`, fixes `P` pointwise), and `h(g)^|P| = 1` since `h(g) ∈ P` and
