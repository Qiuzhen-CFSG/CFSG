# Theorem D subnode: `Qd(p)` excluded by the two-prime structure

This module proves the exact source step of the proof of Theorem D
(`refs/glauberman-p-stable.tex` L1979–L1981): if `p` is odd, the only prime
divisors of `|G|` are `p` and a prime `q ≠ p`, and the Sylow `q`-subgroups are
Abelian, then every Sylow `2`-subgroup is Abelian and therefore `Qd(p)` is not
involved in `G`.

The Sylow `2` argument is a case split:

* if `2 ∣ |G|`, the two-prime hypothesis forces `q = 2`, and Abelianness comes
  from the given Sylow `q`-subgroup hypothesis;
* if `2 ∤ |G|`, every Sylow `2`-subgroup has order one, hence is trivial and
  Abelian.

The conclusion is then `Glauberman.qd_not_involved_of_abelian_sylow_two`.
