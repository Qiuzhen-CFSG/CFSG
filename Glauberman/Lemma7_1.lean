# Glauberman, "A Characteristic Subgroup of a p-Stable Group" — Lemma 7.1

This file proves Lemma 7.1 of [6] (Glauberman, *A Characteristic Subgroup of a p-Stable
Group*, Canad. J. Math. 20 (1968), 1101–1135), following the validated transcription in
`refs/glauberman-p-stable.tex` L1816–L1838:

> **Lemma.**  Let `G` be a finite group and `p` a prime.  Suppose that `H ⊆ G` and
> `G = O_{p'}(G)H`.  Let `W` be a `p`-subgroup of `H`.  If `g ∈ G` and `W^g ⊆ H`, then
> there exist `c ∈ O_{p'}(G) ∩ C(W)` and `h ∈ H` such that `g = ch`.

Here `O_{p'}(G)` is `pPrimeCore p G`, the hypothesis `G = O_{p'}(G)H` is taken in its
join form `pPrimeCore p G ⊔ H = ⊤` (the product decomposition is equivalent because
`O_{p'}(G) ⊴ G`), and `W` is a `p`-subgroup of `H` (i.e. `W : Subgroup H` with
`IsPGroup p W`; elements of `W` are lifted to `G` through the inclusion `H.subtype`).

**Conjugation convention.**  The paper writes `x^a = a⁻¹xa` throughout.  Accordingly the
hypothesis is stated as `∀ w : W, g⁻¹ * (w : G) * g ∈ H` (i.e. `W^g ⊆ H` in the paper's
convention — the same convention as `Glauberman.conjSubset`).  The statement pinned in the
round-2 ledger writes `g * (w : G) * g⁻¹ ∈ H`, which is `W^(g⁻¹)` in the paper's convention;
the two are *not* interchangeable in the conclusion `g = c·h` with `c` on the left (the
mirrored argument with `g` replaced by `g⁻¹` produces a factorization `g = h·c` with `h ∈ H`,
`c ∈ O_{p'}(G) ∩ C(W)`, which cannot in general be re-ordered to `g = c'·h'` with
`c' ∈ O_{p'}(G) ∩ C(W)`).  This file therefore follows the paper's convention; this is a
recorded statement drift from the pinned element form (the theorem is the same statement,
with the hypothesis expressed in the paper's conjugation convention).

## Proof route (paper L1816–L1838)

1. *Product decomposition.*  From `pPrimeCore p G ⊔ H = ⊤` and normality of `N = O_{p'}(G)`,
   `g = b·k` with `b ∈ N`, `k ∈ H`.
2. *`W^b ⊆ H`.*  For `w ∈ W`, `w^b = b⁻¹wb = (w^g)^{k⁻¹} = k·(g⁻¹wg)·k⁻¹ ∈ H`.
3. *`R = ⟨W, W^b⟩`.*  With `W' = W.map H.subtype` and `Wb = {b⁻¹wb | w ∈ W'}`, put
   `R = W' ⊔ Wb ⊆ H`.  Each generator of `Wb` is `(b⁻¹·w·b·w⁻¹)·w` with
   `b⁻¹·w·b·w⁻¹ ∈ N`, so `Wb ≤ N ⊔ W'` and dually `W' ≤ N ⊔ Wb`; hence `R ≤ N ⊔ W'` and
   `R ≤ N ⊔ Wb`, which yields the two decompositions
   `R = L·W' = L·Wb` (as sets, `L := N ⊓ R`): every `r ∈ R` is `n·w` with `n = r·w⁻¹ ∈ R ∩ N = L`.
4. *Sylow.*  `W'` and `Wb` are Sylow `p`-subgroups of `R`: both are `p`-groups, and with
   `L = N ⊓ R` one has `Subgroup.IsComplement' (L.subgroupOf R) (W'.subgroupOf R)` (disjoint: a
   `p`-group and a `p'`-group; product `= ⊤`: the decomposition), so
   `(W'.subgroupOf R).index = Nat.card L`, which is not divisible by `p` (its cardinal
   divides `Nat.card N`, coprime to `p`); by `IsPGroup.toSylow`, `W'.subgroupOf R` is a
   Sylow `p`-subgroup of `R`, and likewise for `Wb`.
5. *Sylow conjugacy.*  Sylow conjugacy inside `R` gives `r ∈ R` with `r • Wb = W` (right
   conjugation `x ↦ r·x·r⁻¹`).  Write `r⁻¹ = l·w` with `l ∈ L`, `w ∈ W'` (decomposition
   above).  Since `w ∈ W'` normalizes `W'`, `Wb = (r⁻¹)·W = (l·w)·W = l·W`, so `l⁻¹` (right)
   conjugates `Wb` into `W'`, i.e. **in the paper's convention** `d := l` satisfies
   `(Wb)^d ⊆ W'`.
6. *`c = bd` centralizes `W`.*  For `x ∈ W'`: `x^b ∈ Wb`, hence `x^{bd} = (x^b)^d ∈ W'`;
   and `x⁻¹·x^{bd} = (x⁻¹·x^b)·((x^b)⁻¹·(x^b)^d) ∈ N` because `b, d ∈ N` and `N ⊴ G`, so
   `x⁻¹·x^{bd} ∈ W' ∩ N = 1`, i.e. `x^{bd} = x` and `c = bd ∈ C(W)`.  (The paper prints
   `x⁻¹x^{bd} ∈ R∩O_{p'}(G) = 1` at this point; the printed equality is a typo — the valid
   inference is `x⁻¹x^{bd} ∈ W ∩ O_{p'}(G) = 1`, using that `x⁻¹x^{bd} ∈ W`, a `p`-group,
   and `O_{p'}(G)` is a `p'`-group.)
7. *Conclusion.*  `c = b·d ∈ N`, `h = d⁻¹·k ∈ H`, and `g = bk = bd·d⁻¹k = c·h`.

/-- **Lemma 7.1** ([6], §7; `refs/glauberman-p-stable.tex` L1816–L1838): if `H ≤ G` with
`G = O_{p'}(G)·H` (in join form: `pPrimeCore p G ⊔ H = ⊤`), `W` is a `p`-subgroup of `H`,
and the conjugate `W^g` (paper convention `x^g = g⁻¹xg`) is contained in `H`, then
`g = c·h` with `c ∈ O_{p'}(G) ∩ C(W)` and `h ∈ H`.

The hypothesis is `∀ w : W, g⁻¹ * (w : G) * g ∈ H` (paper conjugation convention; see the
module docstring for why this differs from the ledger's pinned element form).  The centralizer
is taken with respect to the lifted subgroup `W.map H.subtype : Subgroup G` (the elements of
`W`, viewed in `G`). -/
