# Bender's order-four Case-1 arithmetic

This module isolates the numerical end of Bender's first case in Section 3
of *Finite groups with large subgroups*.

/-- Bender's aggregate Case-1 data force `a = 9`, no singly occupied
cosets, forty-five involutions, and ambient order `360`.

The divisibility hypothesis is Lemma 2's orbit congruence after the
fixed-point-free term is shown to vanish. -/
