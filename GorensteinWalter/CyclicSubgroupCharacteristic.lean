/-! # Cyclic subgroups have all their subgroups normalized

If a cyclic subgroup `C` of a finite group is normalized by `g`, then every
subgroup `X ≤ C` is also normalized by `g`.  The proof uses the fact that in a
cyclic group every subgroup is fully invariant under every endomorphism, so a
conjugate of `X` inside `C` with the same cardinality must be `X` itself.
