# A divisor bound for odd powers

If `r` and `p` are odd, then the common divisors of `r + 1` and
`(r ^ p + 1) / 2` already divide `(r + 1) / 2`.

/-- For odd `r` and odd `p`, a number dividing both `r + 1` and half of
`r ^ p + 1` divides half of `r + 1`.

The quotient `(r ^ p + 1) / (r + 1)` is represented by the positive
alternating geometric sum in `ℤ`; it is odd because it contains an odd number
of odd summands. -/
