# Centralization of invariant odd-prime subgroups in S4

An odd-prime subgroup of `S₄` normalized by the centralizer of an
involution is centralized by that involution.  Order considerations reduce
to a subgroup of order three; the remaining finite fact is certified over
the concrete permutation group.
