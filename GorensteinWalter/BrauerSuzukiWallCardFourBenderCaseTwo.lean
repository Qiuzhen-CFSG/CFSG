# Bender's second counting case in the order-four branch

This module isolates the arithmetic endpoint of Case 2 in Section 3 of
Bender's *Finite groups with large subgroups*.  The case hypothesis is the
containment `C_G(X) ≤ N_G(V)`.  The remaining group-theoretic input is stated
as the two aggregate coset-counting hypotheses used by the generic
involution/coset inequality.

/-- In Bender's branch `C_G(X) ≤ N_G(V)`, suppose the source's aggregate
coset count has been established: there are six non-base cosets containing
two involutions, no contribution from cosets containing three or more
involutions, and `singleCosets` cosets containing one involution.  Then the
generic Bender inequality forces the group to have order `168`.

The first aggregate hypothesis counts the occupied cosets.  The second is
Lemma 2(1) from Bender's paper after substituting `|J ∩ N_G(V)| = 9` and
`b₂ = 6`. -/
