# The normalizer of the Klein-four two-core

The source uses `N_G(V)=Ĥ`, where `V=O₂(Ĥ)`.  The point is that an element
normalizing `V` sends the distinguished involution `t` to another nontrivial
element of `V`; Theorem 2.6 fuses that element back to `t` inside `Ĥ`, and the
remaining factor centralizes `t`.
