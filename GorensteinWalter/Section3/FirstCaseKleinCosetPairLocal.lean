# Local commuting-pair bookkeeping for the first-case count

The external involutions in a non-base `Ĥ`-coset are written `h * y` with
`h ∈ I_Ĥ(y)`.  Two such involutions commute exactly when the quotient
`h₁ * h₂⁻¹` is itself an involution of `Ĥ`.  This module isolates that
purely group-theoretic translation; the per-coset distribution lemma that
uses it will be added next to `FirstCaseKleinCosetPairIncidence`.

/-- For involutions `y` outside `H` and inverted elements `h₁, h₂ ∈ H`,
the external involutions `h₁ * y` and `h₂ * y` commute iff
`h₁ * h₂⁻¹` is an involution. -/
