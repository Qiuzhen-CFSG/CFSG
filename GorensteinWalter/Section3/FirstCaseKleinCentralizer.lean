# Ambient centralizers of the Klein-four two-core

In the Klein-four branch, every nonidentity element of
`V = O₂(Ĥ)` is an involution fused to the distinguished involution inside
`Ĥ`.  Consequently its ambient centralizer is contained in `Ĥ`.  This is the
centralizer bound used in the source's restriction (5).
