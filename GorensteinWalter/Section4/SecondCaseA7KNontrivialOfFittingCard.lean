# The missing nontriviality transfer for the `A₇` inverted subgroup

The quotient-cardinality argument for `U ∩ M` does not by itself show that
the inverted subgroup `K` is nontrivial.  The source first passes through the
fitting intersection `F(U) ∩ M`.  This module records the exact transfer in a
form that is reusable once the source supplies
`|(F(U) ∩ M)/O₂′(M)| = 3`.

/-- If the fitting intersection has quotient image of order three, then the
`K` supplied by equations (1)--(3) is nontrivial.  This is the precise
nontriviality leg needed before upgrading the unconditional bound
`|K| ≤ 3` to the source equality `|K| = 3`.
