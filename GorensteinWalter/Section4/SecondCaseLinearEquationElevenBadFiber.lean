# Section 4, equation (11): the bad-fibre bound (`P × E` / `X × E^g`)

This module formalizes Bender's bad-fibre estimate on lines 859--883 of
`refs/bender-dihedral-sylow.tex` (the paragraph starting
"Take any subgroup `Y` of `X × E^g` not lying in `M`" and ending with
"not more than `((q-1)/p) q` conjugates `Y` of `P` ... satisfy `Q ≠ 1`").

## Source content (L859--883)

Fix a conjugate `X = P^g ⊆ A` of the chosen order-`p` subgroup `P`, the
region `X · E^g`, and `PE = P · E`.  For a subgroup `Y ≤ X · E^g` with
`Y ⊄ M` (equivalently `A ⊄ D := C_{PE}(Y)`) the centralizer
`D = C_{PE}(Y)` has `X` as a Sylow-`p` subgroup and `N_D(X)` has a normal
complement `Q` in `D` with `|Q| | q` (the exceptional `|Q| = 4` case is
excluded by the component-centralizer control
`C_G(⟨t,s⟩) = ⟨t,s⟩B ⊆ M`; that exclusion is part of establishing the
structure hypothesis `hD` below, and is never decided by enumeration).
Consequently `Y` centralizes at most `q` conjugates of `P` in `P × E`,
and symmetrically a minimal `X`-invariant `W ≤ PE` with `|W| | q` is
centralized by at most `q` conjugates of `P` in `X · E^g`.  Since the
number of minimal `X`-invariant subgroups `W ≤ PE` with `|W| | q` is at
most `(q-1)/p` (because `X` normalizes at most two subgroups of order `q`
and `2p = 2|X|` divides `|W^#|`), at most `((q-1)/p) · q` conjugates `Y`
of `P` lying in `X · E^g` but not in `M` satisfy `Q ≠ 1`.

## Formal structure

Following the established pattern of
`secondCase_linearEquation11_orbit_card_of_unique_torus_family`, the
counting argument is proven in full here, while the Section-4/PSL₂
group-theoretic facts asserted by the source in single sentences are
explicit hypotheses:

* `hD` — the per-`Y` structure of `D = C_{PE}(Y)`: `X` is a Sylow-`p`
  subgroup of `D` and `N_D(X)` has a normal complement `Q` with
  `|Q| | q` (this packages the source's "`X` is an `S_p`-subgroup of
  `D` ... normal complement `Q` ... with `|Q|` dividing `q`", including
  the `|Q| = 4` exclusion via the component-centralizer control);
* `hW` — the symmetric structure of `D' = C_{X·E^g}(W)` for the minimal
  `X`-invariant `W`'s (the source's "similarly ... W of P×E not
  centralized by A is centralized by at most q conjugates of P in
  X×E^g"); every minimal `X`-invariant `W` with `|W| | q` fails to lie
  in `C_{PE}(A) = PKS₀` because `PKS₀` has no elements of order dividing
  `q`, so no separate "not centralized by `A`" condition is needed;
* `hWcount` — the bound `(q-1)/p` on the number of minimal
  `X`-invariant `W ≤ PE` with `|W| | q` (the source's "X normalizes at
  most two subgroups of order q in P×E and 2p = 2|X| divides |W^#|").

Everything else — the orbit-count `|{order-p subgroups of D}| =
|D : N_D(X)|` from Sylow's theorems, the complement index identity
`|D : N_D(X)| = |Q|`, the "at most `q`" bounds, the existence of a
minimal `X`-invariant `W ≤ Q_Y` for every bad `Y`, and the final union
bound — is proven here.  The conclusion is exported in the exact shape
consumed by `secondCase_linearEquation11_region_producer` (the `hBad`
hypothesis):

```lean
∀ x : Xs,
  Nat.card {Y : Subgroup G // (∃ g : G, Y = P.map (MulAut.conj g).toMonoidHom) ∧
      Y ≤ R x ∧ Y ≠ X x ∧ ¬ (Y ≤ w.M) ∧
      secondCase_linearEquation11_bad_pred PE q (X x) Y} ≤ ((q - 1) / p) * q
```

with NAT division in `((q - 1) / p) * q`.  No `sorry`/`admit`/`axiom`/
`opaque`/`native_decide` are used.
