# The product-centralizer has enough `2`-part

For a reflection `r` commuting with the distinguished involution `t`, the
product `tr` is an involution.  Fusion of involutions sends `tr` to `t`, so a
conjugate of the fixed dihedral Sylow lies in `C_G(tr)`.  When the dihedral
parameter is at least two this proves `8 ∣ |C_G(tr)|`, the hypothesis needed
for the source's product-centralizer conjugator.
