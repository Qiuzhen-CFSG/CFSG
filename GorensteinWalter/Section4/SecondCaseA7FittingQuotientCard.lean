# The fitting-intersection quotient-card transfer

This is the small finite core behind the source's `F/B` argument.  If the
fixed part `F` is cyclic while `F(U) ∩ M` is noncyclic, then the quotient image
of `F(U) ∩ M` cannot be trivial once the inverted part `K₀` is disjoint from
the odd core.  Combined with an odd-order upper bound of three, the image
therefore has cardinality exactly three.
