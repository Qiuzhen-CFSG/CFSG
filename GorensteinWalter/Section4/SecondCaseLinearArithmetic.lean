# Section 4: arithmetic core of the linear contradiction

This module isolates the pure numeric reduction of Bender's Section 4,
equations (10)--(12).  The later group-theoretic lane supplies the
parameters `q`, `k`, `k'`, `p`, `p₀`, `p₁`, `u`, the index `m = |G : M|`,
the conjugate-count `L`, the equations

* (10) `q k' m ≤ 6 k² u³ p₀³`,
* (11) `(p₁ - 1) q k' L ≤ m`,

and the parameter relations

* `k ≤ (q+1)/2`, `(q-1)/2 ≤ k'`, `q ≥ 7`,
* `3 ≤ p₀ ≤ p₁`, `p₀ ≤ p`, `2p ≤ k`, `u ≤ p`,

all in `ℚ`; this file derives the source's final contradiction.
Equation (12) is derived from (10) and (11) exactly as in the paper:
multiply (11) by `q k'` and chain with (10).
