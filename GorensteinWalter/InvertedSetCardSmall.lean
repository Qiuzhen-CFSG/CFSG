# Small cardinalities of inverted sets

For an outside involution `y`, the inverted set `I_H(y) = {x ∈ H |
y * x * y⁻¹ = x⁻¹}` has size at most four in the first-case count.  This
module pins the structure needed when that size is two or three:

* size two: the non-identity element is an involution;
* size three: every non-identity element has order three, so `I_H(y)` is
  the cyclic subgroup of order three, and no two external involutions
  `i * y`, `j * y` commute.
