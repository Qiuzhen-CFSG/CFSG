# The order-seven structural conclusion in the order-four branch

This module packages the reusable endpoint of Bender's second order-four
case.  Once an order-three subgroup is self-centralizing and has its usual
dihedral normalizer, the ambient order `168` forces the `q = 7`
Brauer--Suzuki--Wall conclusion.  No low-order recognition theorem is used.

/-- In the `|K| = 4`, `|G| = 168` branch, a self-centralizing subgroup `D`
of order three with an inverting normalizer complement supplies the
`q = 7` Brauer--Suzuki--Wall structural conclusion.

The Klein four subgroup rules out a normal Sylow-seven subgroup: its
conjugation action on a normal subgroup of order seven would be fixed-point
free away from the identity, contradicting `4 ∤ 6`.  The order-three group
then fixes a Sylow-seven subgroup `Q`; Sylow counting gives
`N_G(Q) = Q ⊔ D`. -/
