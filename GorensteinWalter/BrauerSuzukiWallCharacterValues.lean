# Character values at the distinguished involution

This is the short square-comparison argument in Bender's
Brauer--Suzuki--Wall proof.  Once the two transferred characters have been
decomposed and their pair-count scalar products compared, the three signed
irreducible constituents have values `2`, `-2`, and `-1` at `t`.
