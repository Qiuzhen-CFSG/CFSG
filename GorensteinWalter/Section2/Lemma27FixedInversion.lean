# A Klein-four fixed involution on an inverted odd subgroup

If an odd normal subgroup `A` of `M` is inverted by an involution `t`, and
`t` lies in a Klein-four subgroup `V` of `M`, then `V` acts faithfully on
`A`.  The Klein-four fixed-point lemma supplies a nonidentity `s ∈ V` with
nontrivial fixed part on `A`; since `t` itself has trivial fixed part on
`A`, this `s` is an involution of `C_M(t)` with a nontrivial fixed subgroup
of `A`.  This is the fixed-point ingredient of the final
`[S,U] ≰ F(U)` step of Lemma 2.7.
