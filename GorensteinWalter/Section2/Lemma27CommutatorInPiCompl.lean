# The `[M, ⟨t⟩] ≤ F_{πᶜ}(M)` step of Lemma 2.7

Once `t` centralizes `F_π(M)` and inverts `F_{πᶜ}(M)`, every commutator
`[m,t]` centralizes `F(M)`.  If `[m,t]` itself lies in the nilpotent
Fitting subgroup and `O₂(M) = 1`, the fact that `t` inverts `[m,t]` forces
the `π`-part of the commutator to be trivial; hence the whole commutator
lies in `F_{πᶜ}(M)`.
