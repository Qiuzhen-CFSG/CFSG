# Bridge from the Section 2 centralizer setup to Bender--Glauberman Hypothesis 1.1

The character-theoretic Theorem B is stated for `BenderGlauberman.Hyp11`.
The Gorenstein--Walter Section 2 setup stores the same Sylow subgroup,
rotation subgroup, central involution, and centralizer, but not the two
reflection generators used by the character paper.  This module constructs
those generators from the cyclic index-two subgroup.

/-- A `CentralizerSetup` satisfying the two recalled Section 2 preamble facts
supplies Bender--Glauberman Hypothesis 1.1.

Choose a generator `a` of the cyclic subgroup `S0` and an element `s` of
`S \ S0`.  Both `s` and `s * a` are reflections, hence involutions, and their
product is `a`; therefore they generate `S0` in the form required by
`BenderGlauberman.Hyp11`. -/
