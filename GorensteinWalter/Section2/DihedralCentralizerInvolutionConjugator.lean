# An involutory conjugator inside a product centralizer

If distinct commuting involutions have a product centralizer of order
divisible by eight, a Sylow subgroup of that centralizer transports into an
ambient dihedral Sylow subgroup.  The product is then the central rotation and
the two involutions are opposite reflections, so an involution inside the
product centralizer interchanges them.

/-- An involutory conjugator inside a prescribed Sylow subgroup of the
product centralizer.

If distinct commuting involutions have a product centralizer of order
divisible by eight, a Sylow subgroup of that centralizer transports into an
ambient dihedral Sylow subgroup.  The product is then the central rotation and
the two involutions are opposite reflections, so an involution inside the
given Sylow subgroup of the product centralizer interchanges them. -/
