# `O₂(M) = 1` for Lemma 2.7

The paper's final normalizer step: once `O₂(M) ≤ O₂(Ĥ)`, a nontrivial
`O₂(M)` is impossible.  When `O₂(Ĥ)` is cyclic this follows from
characteristicity in the cyclic subgroup; when it is a Klein four, every
involution there is conjugate to `t` inside `Ĥ`, so the order-two normal
subgroup `O₂(M)` has centralizer (hence normalizer) inside `Ĥ`.
