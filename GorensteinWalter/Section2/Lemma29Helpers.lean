# Elementary intersection endpoints for Lemma 2.9

The source proof of Lemma 2.9 first forces the distinguished involution into
one of two normal layers.  This module records the small lattice step that is
independent of the harder D-group and component arguments: a nonidentity
element common to two subgroups makes their intersection nontrivial.
