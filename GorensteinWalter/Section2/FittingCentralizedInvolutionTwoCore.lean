# A centralized involution forces a nontrivial two-core

When the component layer is trivial, the generalized Fitting subgroup is the
ordinary Fitting subgroup.  Its self-centralizing property then makes any
involution centralizing the Fitting subgroup lie in it.  The two/odd
decomposition of the Fitting subgroup forces such an involution into the
two-core.
