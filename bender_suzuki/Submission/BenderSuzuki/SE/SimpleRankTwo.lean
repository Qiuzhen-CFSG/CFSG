# The simple rank-two exclusion

The final clause of Theorem SE uses `[IG; 15.2, 15.3]` to exclude the
rank-one alternative for a simple group with a strongly embedded subgroup.
The rank-one factorization is proved in `SE.RankOne`; here we supply the
checked simple-group bridge and expose the exact interface consumed by the
final reduction.
