# Section 11, Lemma 11.3: prime-power arithmetic

The Mersenne-power endpoint in the disjoint branch is an internal arithmetic
consequence of the checked prime-power successor trichotomy.  It is kept in a
small module so the group-theoretic branch does not need to import the whole
Peterfalvi claim file directly.

/-- If an odd prime power is one less than a positive power of `2`, the
successor exponent of the odd prime power is `1`.  In the Lemma 11.3
specialization this says `a = 0` from `r^(a+1) = 2^b - 1`. -/
