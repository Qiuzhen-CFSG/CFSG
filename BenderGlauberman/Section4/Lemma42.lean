# Bender--Glauberman: Lemma 4.2

For every Section-4 character `μ` there is a character `μ'` of `G` such that
`(δν, μ')_G` is odd exactly when `ν̂` and `μ̂` are conjugate under
`N_G(S)`.  The character is the induction to `G` of `μ̂`, inflated from
`B` to `C_G(S) = S × B`.

/-- Lemma 4.2: there is a character `μ'` of `G` whose scalar product with
`δν` is odd exactly when `ν̂` is `N_G(S)`-conjugate to `μ̂`.  The proof is
independent of `μ`'s behaviour under `s` and at `t`, so the statement takes
an arbitrary `μ : Irr(H0)`. -/
