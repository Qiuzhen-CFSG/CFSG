Hypothesis (A) makes the point stabilizer strongly embedded, so each of the three
families in the conclusion of the Suzuki classification does have a strongly
embedded subgroup.

The results are stated with `IsStronglyEmbedded` as `BenderSuzuki.FinalTheorem`
defines it -- the same predicate `bender_suzuki` takes as its hypothesis, and the only
notion of strong embedding this development introduces.  The proof below naturally
produces the parity form (`|H|` even, `|H ⊓ H^g|` odd); `isStronglyEmbedded_of_parity`
converts it, by Cauchy's theorem at the prime two, and that form is never stated.

Only one direction is proved: `HypothesisA → IsStronglyEmbedded`.  The reverse --
recovering the Zassenhaus configuration from a strongly embedded subgroup alone -- is the
hard content of Bender's 1971 paper and is not formalized here.  Neither is the statement
that an arbitrary group satisfying the conclusion of the classification has a strongly
embedded subgroup; what is proved is that the three families do, which is what the
equivalence in `BenderSuzuki.Classification` needs.

The three witnesses are assembled from the classical facts in `External/`.  Peterfalvi
states Theorem A in one direction only, so this direction is not a transcription of a
numbered result in any source.

/-- **Hypothesis (A) makes the point stabilizer strongly embedded.**

`H` is proper because the involution `t` lies outside it, and has even order because it
contains `Q`.  For `g ∉ H` the intersection `H ⊓ gHg⁻¹` is the stabilizer of the pair of
distinct points `ω`, `g • ω`, hence has the same order as `D` by double transitivity —
and `|D|` is odd. -/
