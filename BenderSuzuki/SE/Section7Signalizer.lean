# Section 7: the Thompson--Bender signalizer step

This file proves the group-theoretic core of Lemma 7.6 in
`docs/cfsg-vol4.tex`.  In the intended application `D` is a two-point
stabilizer of odd order, `E ≤ D`, and `W₁` is a `p`-subgroup satisfying
`W₁ C_D(W₁) ≤ E`.  A Sylow `p`-subgroup of that product supplies the
centralizer hypothesis of the Thompson--Bender signalizer lemma, yielding
`theta(E) ≤ theta(D)`.

/-- Lemma 7.6, in the exact subgroup form consumed after `(7C)`.

Here `W` is the subgroup `W₁ ≤ D`, and the last hypothesis is the source
containment `W₁ C_D(W₁) ≤ E`, with a subgroup product represented by `⊔`.
Since `D` has odd order, `O₂'(D) = D`, so the source auxiliary group
`D₁ = W₁ O₂'(D)` is simply `D`.  The proof constructs the required Sylow
subgroup, verifies the Thompson--Bender centralizer and coprimality hypotheses,
and concludes `theta(E) ≤ theta(D)`. -/
